# Serverless Parallel Workloads

This repository contains 5 different parallelized workloads and their adaptions to AWS Lambda, GCF and GCR. Each workload is written in C++, Java and Go.

The Microbenchmarks, consisting of Atax, MVT and Go Fast, have been taken from the [NPBench](https://github.com/spcl/npbench) Github repository and translated afterwards.
